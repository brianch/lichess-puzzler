lichess puzzler (WC version)
----------------------------

This is a fork of the [lichess puzzle generator](https://github.com/ornicar/lichess-puzzler) (also know as puzzles v2) that allow to generate puzzles from unanalysed PGN for your own usage. See [the generator's README for detailed instructions.](https://github.com/kraktus/lichess-puzzler/tree/WC/generator#readme)


Why WC (World Championship) version? Because I first developped it when I wanted to extract puzzles from 2021's WC games so we could include them in Lichess blogs.
